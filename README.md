# **MacGyver MAZE**
Help MacGyver to escape the maze! (there is only one level)
# Project n°3 of OpenClassrooms
Description
* The structure (start, location of the walls, finish) is saved in a file.txt for easy modification if needed.
* MacGyver will be controlled by the directional keys on the keyboard.
* Les objets seront répartis aléatoirement dans le labyrinthe et changeront d’emplacement si l'utilisateur ferme le jeu et le relance.
* The game window will be a square that can display 15 sprites in length.
* MacGyver will therefore have to move from square to square.
* It will pick up an item simply by moving over it.
* The program stops if MacGyver finds the way out of the maze.
* If he does not have all the items and he appears in front of the guard, he dies (life is cruel for the heroes).
